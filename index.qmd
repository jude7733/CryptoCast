## Project Overview ðŸ“ˆ

This project aims to forecast the price of 50 crypto coins using historical daily price data. The analysis covers the entire data science workflow, from data acquisition and cleaning to modeling and evaluation.

Data for this analysis was sourced from **[daniyalatta/top-50-cryptocurrencies-historical2020-2025-1h](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/daniyalatta/top-50-cryptocurrencies-historical2020-2025-1h). We explore several time series models to identify which one provides the most accurate short-term predictions. The goal is to create a reproducible workflow that can be easily updated with new data.
